"Don Wan has taken all the flour, Mr. Mulford, and intends shoving
it over into Cuba, without troubling the custom-house, I believe;
but that is not a matter to give us any concern, you know."

The wink, and the knowing look by which this speech was accompanied,
seemed particularly disagreeable to Don Juan, who now paid his
compliments to Rose, with no little surprise betrayed in his
countenance, but with the ease and reserve of a gentleman. Mulford
thought it strange that a smuggler of flour should be so polished a
personage, though his duty did not admit of his bestowing much
attention on the little trifling of the interview that succeeded.

For about an hour the work went steadily and rapidly on. During that
time Mulford was several times on board the schooner, as, indeed,
was Josh, Jack Tier, and others belonging to the Swash. The Spanish
vessel was Baltimore, or clipper built, with a trunk-cabin, and had
every appearance of sailing fast. Mulford was struck with her model,
and, while on board of her, he passed both forward and aft to
examine it. This was so natural in a seaman, that Spike, while he
noted the proceeding, took it in good part. He even called out to
his mate, from his own quarter-deck, to admire this or that point in
the schooner's construction. As is customary with the vessels of
southern nations, this stranger was full of men, but they continued
at their work, some half dozen of brawny negroes among them,
shouting their songs as they swayed at the falls, no one appearing
to manifest jealousy or concern. At length Tier came near the mate,
and said,

"Uncle Sam will not be pleased when he hears the reason that the
keeper is not in his light-house."

"And what is that reason, Jack? If you know it, tell it to me."

"Go aft and look down the companion-way, maty, and see it for
yourself."

Mulford did go aft, and he made an occasion to look down into the
schooner's cabin, where he caught a glimpse of the persons of a man
and a boy, whom he at once supposed had been taken from the
light-house. This one fact of itself doubled his distrust of the
character of Spike's proceedings. There was no sufficient apparent
reason why a mere smuggler should care about the presence of an
individual more or less in a foreign port. Everything that had
occurred, looked like pre-concert between the brig and the schooner;
and the mate was just beginning to entertain the strongest distrust
that their vessel was holding treasonable communication with the
enemy, when an accident removed all doubt on the subject, from his
own mind at least. Spike had, once or twice, given his opinion that
the weather was treacherous, and urged the people of both crafts to
extraordinary exertions, in order that the vessels might get clear
of each other as soon as possible. This appeal had set various
expedients in motion to second the more regular work of the
purchases. Among other things, planks had been laid from one vessel
to the other, and barrels were rolled along them with very little
attention to the speed or the direction. Several had fallen on the
schooner's deck with rude shocks, but no damage was done, until one,
of which the hoops had not been properly secured, met with a fall,
and burst nearly at Mulford's feet. It was at the precise moment
when the mate was returning, from taking his glance into the cabin,
toward the side of the Swash. A white cloud arose, and half a dozen
of the schooner's people sprang for buckets, kids, or dishes, in
order to secure enough of the contents of the broken barrel to
furnish them with a meal. At first nothing was visible but the white
cloud that succeeded the fall, and the scrambling sailors in its
midst. No sooner, however, had the air got to be a little clear,
than Mulford saw an object lying in centre of the wreck, that he at
once recognised for a keg of the gunpowder! The captain of the
schooner seized this keg, gave a knowing look at Mulford, and
disappeared in the hold of his own vessel, carrying with him, what
was out of all question, a most material part of the true cargo of
the Swash.

At the moment when the flour-barrel burst, Spike was below, in close
conference with his Spanish, or Mexican guest; and the wreck being
so soon cleared away, it is probable that he never heard of the
accident. As for the two crews, they laughed a little among
themselves at the revelation which had been made, as well as at the
manner; but to old sea-dogs like them, it was a matter of very
little moment, whether the cargo was, in reality, flour or
gunpowder. In a few minutes the affair seemed to be forgotten. In
the course of another hour the Swash was light, having nothing in
her but some pig-lead, which she used for ballast, while the
schooner was loaded to her hatches, and full. Spike now sent a boat,
with orders to drop a kedge about a hundred yards from the place
where his own brig lay. The schooner warped up to this kedge, and
dropped an anchor of her own, leaving a very short range of cable
out, it being a flat calm. Ordinarily, the trades prevail at the Dry
Tortugas, and all along the Florida Reef. Sometimes, indeed, this
breeze sweeps across the whole width of the Gulf of Mexico, blowing
home, as it is called--reaching even to the coast of Texas. It is
subject, however, to occasional interruptions everywhere, varying
many points in its direction, and occasionally ceasing entirely. The
latter was the condition of the weather about noon on this day, or
when the schooner hauled off from the brig, and was secured at her
own anchor.

"Mr. Mulford," said Spike, "I do not like the state of the
atmosphere. D'ye see that fiery streak along the western
horizon--well, sir, as the sun gets nearer to that streak, there'll
be trouble, or I'm no judge of weather."

"You surely do not imagine, Captain Spike, that the sun will be any
nearer to that fiery streak, as you call it, when he is about to
set, than he is at this moment?" answered the mate, smiling.

"I'm sure of one thing, young man, and that is, that old heads are
better than young ones. What a man has once seen, he may expect to
see again, if the same leading signs offer. Man the boat, sir, and
carry out the kedge, which is still in it, and lay it off here,
about three p'ints on our larboard bow."

Mulford had a profound respect for Spike's seamanship, whatever he
might think of his principles. The order was consequently obeyed.
The mate was then directed to send down various articles out of the
top, and to get the top-gallant and royal yards on deck. Spike
carried his precautions so far, as to have the mainsail lowered, it
ordinarily brailing at that season of the year, with a standing
gaff. With this disposition completed, the captain seemed more at
his ease, and went below to join Senor Montefalderon in a siesta.
The Mexican, for such, in truth, was the national character of the
owner of the schooner, had preceded him in this indulgence; and most
of the people of the brig having laid themselves down to sleep under
the heat of the hour, Mulford soon enjoyed another favourable
opportunity for a private conference with Rose.

"Harry," commenced the latter, as soon as they were alone; "I have
much to tell you. While you have been absent I have overheard a
conversation between this Spanish gentleman and Spike, that shows
the last is in treaty with the other for the sale of the brig. Spike
extolled his vessel to the skies, while Don Wan, as he calls him,
complains that the brig is old, and cannot last long; to which Spike
answered `to be sure she is old, Senor Montefalderon, but she will
last as long as your war, and under a bold captain might be made to
return her cost a hundred fold!' What war can he mean, and to what
does such a discourse tend?"

"The war alludes to the war now existing between America and Mexico,
and the money to be made is to be plundered at sea, from our own
merchant-vessels. If Don Juan Montefalderon is really in treaty for
the purchase of the brig, it is to convert her into a Mexican
cruiser, either public or private."

"But this would be treason on the part of Spike!"

"Not more so than supplying the enemy with gunpowder, as he has just
been doing. I have ascertained the reason he was so unwilling to be
overhauled by the revenue steamer, as well as the reason why the
revenue steamer wished so earnestly to overhaul us. Each barrel of
flour contains another of gunpowder, and that has been sold to this
Senor Montefalderon, who is doubtless an officer of the Mexican
government, and no smuggler."

"He has been at New York, this very summer, I know," continued Rose,
"for he spoke of his visit, and made such other remarks, as leaves
no doubt that Spike expected to find him here, on this very day of
the month. He also paid Spike a large sum of money in doubloons, and
took back the bag to his schooner, when he had done so, after
showing the captain enough was left to pay for the brig could they
only agree on the terms of their bargain."

"Ay, ay; it is all plain enough now, Spike has determined on a
desperate push for fortune, and foreseeing it might not soon be in
his power to return to New York in safety, he has included his
designs on you and your fortune, in the plot."

"My fortune! the trifle I possess can scarcely be called a fortune,
Harry!"

"It would be a fortune to Spike, Rose; and I shall be honest enough
to own it would be a fortune to me. I say this frankly, for I do
believe you think too well of me to suppose that I seek you for any
other reason than the ardent love I bear your person and character;
but a fact is not to be denied because it may lead certain persons
to distrust our motives. Spike is poor, like myself; and the brig is
not only getting to be very old, but she has been losing money for
the last twelve months."

Mulford and Rose now conversed long and confidentially, on their
situation and prospects. The mate neither magnified nor concealed
the dangers of both; but freely pointed out the risk to himself, in
being on board a vessel that was aiding and comforting the enemy. It
was determined between there that both would quit the brig the
moment an opportunity offered; and the mate even went so far as to
propose an attempt to escape in one of the boats, although he might
incur the hazards of a double accusation, those of mutiny and
larceny, for making the experiment. Unfortunately, neither Rose, nor
her aunt, nor Biddy, nor Jack Tier had seen the barrel of powder,
and neither could testify as to the true character of Spike's
connection with the schooner. It was manifestly necessary,
therefore, independently of the risks that might be run by "bearding
the lion in his den," to proceed with great intelligence and
caution.

This dialogue between Harry and Rose, occurred just after the turn
in the day, and lasted fully an hour. Each had been too much
interested to observe the heavens, but, as they were on the point of
separating, Rose pointed out to her companion the unusual and most
menacing aspect of the sky in the western horizon. It appeared as if
a fiery heat was glowing there, behind a curtain of black vapour;
and what rendered it more remarkable, was the circumstance that an
extraordinary degree of placidity prevailed in all other parts of
the heavens. Mulford scarce knew what to make of it; his experience
not going so far as to enable him to explain the novel and alarming
appearance. He stepped on a gun, and gazed around him for a moment.
There lay the schooner, without a being visible on board of her, and
there stood the light-house, gloomy in its desertion and solitude.
The birds alone seemed to be alive and conscious of what was
approaching. They were all on the wing, wheeling wildly in the air,
and screaming discordantly, as belonged to their habits. The young
man leaped off the gun, gave a loud call to Spike, at the
companion-way, and sprang forward to call all hands.

One minute only was lost, when every seaman on board the Swash, from
the captain to Jack Tier, was on deck. Mulford met Spike at the
cabin door, and pointed toward the fiery column, that was booming
down upon the anchorage, with a velocity and direction that would
now admit of no misinterpretation. For one instant that sturdy old
seaman stood aghast; gazing at the enemy as one conscious of his
impotency might have been supposed to quail before an assault that
he foresaw must prove irresistible. Then his native spirit, and most
of all the effects of training, began to show themselves in him, and
he became at once, not only the man again, but the resolute,
practised, and ready commander.

"Come aft to the spring, men--" he shouted--"clap on the spring, Mr.
Mulford, and bring the brig head to wind."

This order was obeyed as seamen best obey, in cases of sudden and
extreme emergency; or with intelligence, aptitude and power. The
brig had swung nearly round, in the desired direction, when the
tornado struck her. It will be difficult, we do not know but it is
impossible, to give a clear and accurate account of what followed.
As most of our readers have doubtless felt how great is the power of
the wind, whiffling and pressing different ways, in sudden and
passing gusts, they have only to imagine this power increased many,
many fold, and the baffling currents made furious, as it might be,
by meeting with resistance, to form some notion of the appalling
strength and frightful inconstancy with which it blew for about a
minute.

Notwithstanding the circumstance of Spike's precaution had greatly
lessened the danger, every man on the deck of the Swash believed the
brig was gone when the gust struck her. Over she went, in fact,
until the water came pouring in above her half-ports, like so many
little cascades, and spouting up through her scupper-holes,
resembling the blowing of young whales. It was the whiffling energy
of the tornado that alone saved her. As if disappointed in not
destroying its intended victim at one swoop, the tornado "let up" in
its pressure, like a dexterous wrestler, making a fresh and
desperate effort to overturn the vessel, by a slight variation in
its course. That change saved the Swash. She righted, and even
rolled in the other direction, or what might be called to windward,
with her decks full of water. For a minute longer these baffling,
changing gusts continued, each causing the brig to bow like a reed
to their power, one lifting as another pressed her down, and then
the weight, or the more dangerous part of the tornado was passed,
though it continued to blow heavily, always in whiffling blasts,
several minutes longer.

During the weight of the gust, no one had leisure, or indeed
inclination to look to aught beyond its effect on the brig. Had one
been otherwise disposed, the attempt would have been useless, for
the wind had filled the air with spray, and near the islets even
with sand. The lurid but fiery tinge, too, interposed a veil that no
human eye could penetrate. As the tornado passed onward, however,
and the winds lulled, the air again became clear, and in five
minutes after the moment when the Swash lay nearly on her side, with
her lower yard-arm actually within a few feet of the water, all was
still and placid around her, as one is accustomed to see the ocean
in a calm, of a summer's afternoon. Then it was that those who had
been in such extreme jeopardy could breathe freely and look about
them. On board the Swash all was well--not a rope-yarn had parted,
or an eyebolt drawn. The timely precautions of Spike had saved his
brig, and great was his joy thereat.

In the midst of the infernal din of the tornado, screams had
ascended from the cabin, and the instant he could quit the deck with
propriety, Mulford sprang below, in order to ascertain their cause.
He apprehended that some of the females had been driven to leeward
when the brig went over, and that part of the luggage or furniture
had fallen on them. In the main cabin, the mate found Senor
Montefalderon just quitting his berth, composed, gentleman-like, and
collected. Josh was braced in a corner nearly grey with fear, while
Jack Tier still lay on the cabin floor, at the last point to which
he had rolled. One word sufficed to let Don Juan know that the gust
had passed, and the brig was safe, when Mulford tapped at the deor
of the inner cabin. Rose appeared, pale, but calm and unhurt.

"Is any one injured?" asked the young man, his mind relieved at
once, as soon as he saw that she who most occupied his thoughts was
safe; "we heard screams from this cabin."

"My aunt and Biddy have been frightened," answered Rose, "but
neither has been hurt. Oh, Harry, what terrible thing has happened
to us? I heard the roaring of--"

" 'T was a tornado," interrupted Mulford eagerly, "but 't is over.
'T was one of those sudden and tremendous gusts that sometimes occur
within the tropics, in which the danger is usually in the first
shock. If no one is injured in this cabin, no one is injured at
all."

"Oh, Mr. Mulford--dear Mr. Mulford!" exclaimed the relict, from the
corner into which she had been followed and jammed by Biddy, "Oh,
Mr. Mulford, are we foundered or not?"

"Heaven be praised, not, my dear ma'am, though we came nearer to it
than I ever was before."

"Are we cap-asided?"

"Nor that, Mrs. Budd; the brig is as upright as a church."

"Upright!" repeated Biddy, in her customary accent,--"is it as a
church? Sure, then, Mr. Mate, 't is a Presbyterian church that you
mane, and that is always totterin'."

"Catholic, or Dutch--no church in York is more completely up and
down than the brig at this moment."

"Get off of me--get off of me, Biddy, and let me rise," said the
widow, with dignity. "The danger is over I see, and, as we return
our thanks for it, we have the consolation of knowing that we have
done our duty. It is incumbent on all, at such moments, to be at
their posts, and to set examples of decision and prudence."

As Mulford saw all was well in the cabin, he hastened on deck,
followed by Senor Montefalderon. Just as they emerged from the
companion-way, Spike was hailing the forecastle.

"Forecastle, there," he cried, standing on the trunk himself as he
did so, and moving from side to side, as if to catch a glimpse of
some object ahead.

"Sir," came back from an old salt, who was coiling up rigging in
that seat of seamanship.

"Where-away is the schooner? She ought to be dead ahead of us, as we
tend now--but blast me if I can see as much as her mast-heads."

At this suggestion, a dozen men sprang upon guns or other objects,
to look for the vessel in question. The old salt forward, however,
had much the best chance, for he stepped on the heel of the
bowsprit, and walked as far out as the knight-heads, to command the
whole view ahead of the brig. There he stood half a minute, looking
first on one side of the head-gear, then the other, when he gave his
trousers a hitch, put a fresh quid in his mouth, and called out in a
voice almost as hoarse as the tempest, that had just gone by,

"The schooner has gone down at her anchor, sir. There's her buoy
watching still, as if nothing had happened; but as for the craft
itself, there's not so much as a bloody yard-arm, or mast-head of
her to be seen!"

This news produced a sensation in the brig at once, as may be
supposed. Even Senor Montefalderon, a quiet, gentleman-like person,
altogether superior in deportment to the bustle and fuss that
usually marks the manners of persons in trade, was disturbed; for to
him the blow was heavy indeed. Whether he were acting for himself,
or was an agent of the Mexican government, the loss was much the
same.

"Tom is right enough," put in Spike, rather coolly for the
circumstances--"that there schooner of yourn has foundered, Don Wan,
as any one can see. She must have cap-sized and filled, for I
obsarved they had left the hatches off, meaning, no doubt, to make
an end of the storage as soon as they had done sleeping."

"And what has become of all her men, Don Esteban?" for so the
Mexican politely called his companion. "Have all my poor countrymen
perished in this disaster?"

"I fear they have, Don Wan; for I see no head, as of any one
swimming. The vessel lay so near that island next to it, that a poor
swimmer would have no difficulty in reaching the place; but there is
no living thing to be seen. But man the boat, men; we will go to the
spot, Senor, and examine for ourselves."

There were two boats in the water, and along-side of the brig. One
was the Swash's yawl, a small but convenient craft, while the other
was much larger, fitted with a sail, and had all the appearance of
having been built to withstand breezes and seas. Mulford felt
perfectly satisfied, the moment he saw this boat, which had come
into the haven in tow of the schooner, that it had been originally
in the service of the light-house keeper. As there was a very
general desire among those on the quarter-deck to go to the
assistance of the schooner, Spike ordered both boats manned, jumping
into the yawl himself, accompanied by Don Juan Montefalderon, and
telling Mulford to follow with the larger craft, bringing with him
as many of the females as might choose to accompany him. As Mrs.
Budd thought it incumbent on her to be active in such a scene, all
did go, including Biddy, though with great reluctance on the part of
Rose.

With the buoy for a guide, Spike had no difficulty in finding the
spot where the schooner lay. She had scarcely shifted her berth in
the least, there having been no time for her even to swing to the
gust, but she had probably cap-sized at the first blast, filled, and
gone down instantly. The water was nearly as clear as the calm, mild
atmosphere of the tropics; and it was almost as easy to discern the
vessel, and all her hamper, as if she lay on a beach. She had sunk
as she filled, or on her side, and still continued in that position.
As the water was little more than three fathoms deep, the upper side
was submerged but a few inches, and her yard-arms would have been
out of the water, but for the circumstance that the yards had canted
under the pressure.

At first, no sign was seen of any of those who had been on board
this ill-fated schooner when she went down. It was known that
twenty-one souls were in her, including the man and the boy who had
belonged to the light-house. As the boat moved slowly over this sad
ruin, however, a horrible and startling spectacle came in view. Two
bodies were seen, within a few feet of the surface of the water, one
grasped in the arms of the other, in the gripe of despair. The man
held in the grasp, was kept beneath the water solely by the
death-lock of his companion, who was himself held where he floated,
by the circumstance that one of his feet was entangled in a rope.
The struggle could not have been long over, for the two bodies were
slowly settling toward the bottom when first seen. It is probable
that both these men had more than once risen to the surface in their
dreadful struggle. Spike seized a boat-hook, and made an effort to
catch the clothes of the nearest body, but ineffectually, both
sinking to the sands beneath, lifeless, and without motion. There
being no sharks in sight, Mulford volunteered to dive and fasten a
line to one of these unfortunate men, whom Don Juan declared at once
was the schooner's captain. Some little time was lost in procuring a
lead-line from the brig, when the lead was dropped alongside of the
drowned. Provided with another piece of the same sort of line, which
had a small running bowline around that which was fastened to the
lead, the mate made his plunge, and went down with great vigour of
arm. It required resolution and steadiness to descend so far into
salt water; but Harry succeeded, and rose with the bodies, which
came up with the slightest impulse. All were immediately got into
the boat, and away the latter went toward the light-house, which was
nearer and more easy of access than the brig.

It is probable that one of these unfortunate men might have been
revived under judicious treatment; but he was not fated to receive
it. Spike, who knew nothing of such matters, undertook to direct
everything, and, instead of having recourse to warmth and gentle
treatment, he ordered the bodies to be rolled on a cask, suspended
them by the heels, and resorted to a sort of practice that might
have destroyed well men, instead of resuscitating those in whom the
vital spark was dormant, if not actually extinct.

Two hours later, Rose, seated in her own cabin, unavoidably
overheard the following dialogue, which passed in English, a
language that Senor Montefalderon spoke perfectly well, as has been
said.

"Well, Senor," said Spike, "I hope this little accident will not
prevent our final trade. You will want the brig now, to take the
schooner's place."

"And how am I to pay you for the brig, Senor Spike, even if I buy
her?"

"I'll ventur' to guess there is plenty of money in Mexico. Though
they do say the government is so backward about paying, I have
always found you punctual, and am not afraid to put faith in you
ag'in."

"But I have no longer any money to pay you half in hand, as I did
for the powder, when last in New York."

"The bag was pretty well lined with doubloons when I saw it last,
Senor."

"And do you know where that bag is; and where there is another that
holds the same sum?"

Spike started, and he mused in silence some little time, ere he
again spoke.

"I had forgotten," he at length answered. "The gold must have all
gone down in the schooner, along with the powder!"

"And the poor men!"

"Why, as for the men, Senor, more may be had for the asking; but
powder and doubloons will be hard to find, when most wanted. Then
the men were poor men, accordin' to my idees of what an able seaman
should be, or they never would have let their schooner turn turtle
with them as she did."

"We will talk of the money, Don Esteban, if you please," said the
Mexican, with reserve.

"With all my heart, Don Wan--nothing is more agreeable to me than
money. How many of them doubloons shall fall to my share, if I raise
the schooner and put you in possession of your craft again?"

"Can that be done, Senor?" demanded Don Juan earnestly.

"A seaman can do almost anything, in that way, Don Wan, if you will
give him time and means. For one-half the doubloons I can find in
the wrack, the job shall be done."

"You can have them," answered Don Juan, quietly, a good deal
surprised that Spike should deem it necessary to offer him any part
of the sum he might find. "As for the powder, I suppose that is lost
to my country."

"Not at all, Don Wan. The flour is well packed around it, and I
don't expect it would take any harm in a month. I shall not only
turn over the flour to you, just as if nothing had happened, but I
shall put four first-rate hands aboard your schooner, who will take
her into port for you, with a good deal more sartainty than forty of
the men you had. My mate is a prime navigator."

This concluded the bargain, every word of which was heard by Rose,
and every word of which she did not fail to communicate to Mulford,
the moment there was an opportunity. The young man heard it with
great interest, telling Rose that he should do all he could to
assist in raising the schooner, in the hope that something might
turn up to enable him to escape in her, taking off Rose and her
aunt. As for his carrying her into a Mexican port, let them trust
him for that! Agreeably to the arrangement, orders were given that
afternoon to commence the necessary preparations for the work, and
considerable progress was made in them by the time the Swash's
people were ordered to knock off work for the night.

After the sun had set, the reaction in the currents again commenced,
and it blew for a few hours heavily, during the night. Toward
morning, however, it moderated, and when the sun re-appeared it
scarcely ever diffused its rays over a more peaceful or quiet day.
Spike caused all hands to be called, and immediately set about the
important business he had before him.

In order that the vessel might be as free as possible, Jack Tier was
directed to skull the females ashore, in the brig's yawl; Senor
Montefalderon, a man of polished manners, as we maintain is very apt
to be the case with Mexican gentlemen, whatever may be the opinion
of this good republic on the subject just at this moment, asked
permission to be of the party. Mulford found an opportunity to beg
Rose, if they landed at the light, to reconnoitre the place well,
with a view to ascertain what facilities it could afford in an
attempt to escape. They did land at the light, and glad enough were
Mrs. Budd, Rose and Biddy to place their feet on terra firm� after
so long a confinement to the narrow limits of a vessel.

"Well," said Jack Tier, as they walked up to the spot where the
buildings stood, "this is a rum place for a light'us, Miss Rose, and
I don't wonder the keeper and his mess-mates has cleared out."

"I am very sorry to say," observed Senor Montefalderon, whose
countenance expressed the concern he really felt, "that the keeper
and his only companion, a boy, were on board the schooner, and have
perished in her, in common with so many of my poor countrymen. There
are the graves of two whom we buried here last evening, after vain
efforts to restore them to life!"

"What a dreadful catastrophe it has been, Senor," said Rose, whose
sweet countenance eloquently expressed the horror and regret she so
naturally felt--"Twenty fellow-beings hurried into eternity without
even an instant for prayer!"

"You feel for them, Senorita--it is natural you should, and it is
natural that I, their countryman and leader, should feel for them,
also. I do not know what God has in reserve for my unfortunate
country! We may have cruel and unscrupulous men among us, Senorita,
but we have thousands who are just, and brave, and honourable."

"So Mr. Mulford tells me, Senor; and he has been much in your ports,
on the west coast."

"I like that young man, and wonder not a little at his and your
situation in this brig--" rejoined the Mexican, dropping his voice
so as not to be heard by their companions, as they walked a little
ahead of Mrs. Budd and Biddy. "The Senor Spike is scarcely worthy to
be his commander or your guardian."

"Yet you find him worthy of your intercourse and trust, Don Juan?"

The Mexican shrugged his shoulders, and smiled equivocally; still,
in a melancholy manner. It would seem he did not deem it wise to
push this branch of the subject further, since he turned to another.

"I like the Senor Mulford," he resumed, "for his general deportment
and principles, so far as I can judge of him on so short an
acquaintance."

"Excuse me, Senor," interrupted Rose, hurriedly--"but you never saw
him until you met him here."

"Never--I understand you, Senorita, and can do full justice to the
young man's character. I am willing to think he did not know the
errand of his vessel, or I should not have seen him now. But what I
most like him for, is this: Last night, during the gale, he and I
walked the deck together, for an hour. We talked of Mexico, and of
this war, so unfortunate for my country already, and which may
become still more so, when he uttered this noble sentiment--`My
country is more powerful than yours, Senor Montefalderon,' he said,
`and in this it has been more favoured by God. You have suffered
from ambitious rulers, and from military rule, while we have been
advancing under the arts of peace, favoured by a most beneficent
Providence. As for this war, I know but little about it, though I
dare say the Mexican government may have been wrong in some things
that it might have controlled and some that it might not--but let
right be where it will, I am sorry to see a nation that has taken so
firm a stand in favour of popular government, pressed upon so hard
by another that is supposed to be the great support of such
principles. America and Mexico are neighbours, and ought to be
friends; and while I do not, cannot blame my own country for
pursuing the war with vigour, nothing would please me more than to
hear peace proclaimed.'"

"That is just like Harry Mulford," said Rose, thoughtfully, as soon
as her companion ceased to speak. "I do wish, Senor, that there
could be no use for this powder, that is now buried in the sea."

Don Juan Montefalderon smiled, and seemed a little surprised that
the fair young thing at his side should have known of the
treacherous contents of the flour-barrels. No doubt he found it
inexplicable, that persons like Rose and Mulford should, seemingly,
be united with one like Spike; but he was too well bred, and,
indeed, too effectually mystified, to push the subject further than
might be discreet.

By this time they were near the entrance of the lighthouse, into
which the whole party entered, in a sort of mute awe at its silence
and solitude. At Senor Montefalderon's invitation, they ascended to
the lantern, whence they could command a wide and fair view of the
surrounding waters. The reef was much more apparent from that
elevation than from below; and Rose could see that numbers of its
rocks were bare, while on other parts of it there was the appearance
of many feet of water. Rose gazed at it with longing eyes, for, from
a few remarks that had fallen from Mulford, she suspected he had
hopes of escaping among its channels and coral.

As they descended and walked through the buildings, Rose also took
good heed of the supplies the place afforded. There were flour, and
beef, and pork, and many other of the common articles of food, as
well as water in a cistern, that caught it as it flowed from the
roof of the dwelling. Water was also to be found in casks--nothing
like a spring or a well existing among those islets. All these
things Rose noted, putting them aside in her memory for ready
reference hereafter.

In the mean time the mariners were not idle. Spike moved his brig,
and moored her, head and stern, alongside of the wreck, before the
people got their breakfasts. As soon as that meal was ended, both
captain and mate set about their duty in earnest. Mulford carried
out an anchor on the off-side of the Swash, and dropped it at a
distance of about eighty fathoms from the vessel's beam. Purchases
were brought from both mast-heads of the brig to the chain of this
anchor, and were hove upon until the vessel was given a heel of more
than a streak, and the cable was tolerably taut. Other purchases
were got up opposite, and overhauled down, in readiness to take hold
of the schooner's masts. The anchor of the schooner was weighed by
its buoy-rope, and the chain, after being rove through the upper or
opposite hawse-hole, brought in on board the Swash. Another chain
was dropped astern, in such a way, that when the schooner came
upright, it would be sure to pass beneath her keel, some six or
eight feet from the rudder. Slings were then sunk over the
mast-heads, and the purchases were hooked on. Hours were consumed in
these preliminary labours, and the people went to dinner as soon as
they were completed.

When the men had dined, Spike brought one of his purchases to the
windlass, and the other to the capstan, though not until each was
bowsed taut by hand; a few minutes having brought the strain so far
on everything, as to enable a seaman, like Spike, to form some
judgment of the likelihood that his preventers and purchases would
stand. Some changes were found necessary to equalize the strain,
but, on the whole, the captain was satisfied with his work, and the
crew were soon ordered to "heave-away; the windlass best."

In the course of half an hour the hull of the vessel, which lay on
its bilge, began to turn on its keel, and the heads of the spars to
rise above the water. This was the easiest part of the process, all
that was required of the purchases being to turn over a mass which
rested on the sands of the bay. Aided by the long levers afforded by
the spars, the work advanced so rapidly, that, in just one hour's
time after his people had begun to heave, Spike had the pleasure to
see the schooner standing upright, alongside of his own brig, though
still sunk to the bottom. The wreck was secured in this position, by
means of guys and preventers, in order that it might not again cant,
when the order was issued to hook on the slings that were to raise
it to the surface. These slings were the chains of the schooner, one
of which went under her keel, while for the other the captain
trusted to the strength of the two hawse-holes, having passed the
cable out of one and in at the other, in a way to serve his
purposes, as has just been stated.

When all was ready, Spike mustered his crew, and made a speech. He
told the men that he was about a job that was out of the usual line
of their duty, and that he knew they had a right to expect extra pay
for such extra work. The schooner contained money, and his object
was to get at it. If he succeeded, their reward would be a doubloon
a man, which would be earning more than a month's wages by
twenty-four hours' work. This was enough. The men wanted to hear no
more; but they cheered their commander, and set about their task in
the happiest disposition possible.

The reader will understand that the object to be first achieved, was
to raise a vessel, with a hold filled with flour and gunpowder, from
off the bottom of the bay to its surface. As she stood, the deck of
this vessel was about six feet under water, and every one will
understand that her weight, so long as it was submerged in a fluid
as dense as that of the sea, would be much more manageable than if
suspended in air. The barrels, for instance, were not much heavier
than the water they displaced, and the wood work of the vessel
itself, was, on the whole, positively lighter than the element in
which it had sunk. As for the water in the hold, that was of the
same weight as the water on the outside of tne craft, and there had
not been much to carry the schooner down, beside her iron, the spars
that were out of water, and her ballast. This last, some ten or
twelve tons in weight, was in fact the principal difficulty, and
alone induced Spike to have any doubts about his eventual success.
There was no foreseeing the result until he had made a trial,
however; and the order was again given to "heave away."

To the infinite satisfaction of the Swash's crew, the weight was
found quite manageable, so long as the hull remained beneath the
water. Mulford, with three or four assistants, was kept on board the
schooner lightening her, by getting the other anchor off her bows,
and throwing the different objects overboard, or on the decks of the
brig. By the time the bulwarks reached the surface, as much was
gained in this way, as was lost by having so much of the lighter
woodwork rise above the water. As a matter of course, however, the
weight increased as the vessel rose, and more especially as the
lower portion of the spars, the bowsprit, boom, &c., from being
buoyant assistants, became so much dead weight to be lifted.

Spike kept a watchful eye on his spars, and the extra supports he
had given them. He was moving, the whole time, from point to point,
feeling shrouds and back-stays, and preventers, in order to
ascertain the degree of strain on each, or examining how the
purchases stood. As for the crew, they cheered at their toil,
incessantly, passing from capstan bars to the handspikes, and vice
vers�.
